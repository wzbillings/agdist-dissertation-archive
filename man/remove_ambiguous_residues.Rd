\title{Remove ambiguous residues from aligned sequences}
\usage{
remove_ambiguous_residues(seqs, ambiguous_residues = "xX?")
}
\arguments{
\item{seqs}{A character vector of aligned amino acid sequences. Sequences may
optionally be named.}

\item{ambiguous_residues}{A length-1 character string where each character
represents a residue to treat as ambiguous. Defaults to `"xX?"`.}
}
\value{
A character vector of the same length as `seqs`, with the same names
  (if any), where all positions containing ambiguous residues in any sequence
  have been removed.
}
\description{
This function removes positions containing specified ambiguous residues
(e.g., "X") from a character vector of aligned sequences. Removal is
performed listwiseâ€”i.e., any position containing an ambiguous residue in any
sequence will be removed from all sequences. This ensures all sequences
remain aligned.
}
\details{
If `ambiguous_residues` is an empty string `""`, no residues will be removed.

A common modification that is required for some distance metrics is
adding a gap character to `ambiguous_residies`, i.e., `"xX?-"`.

\examples{
seqs <- c(a = "ACDXFG", b = "AXCXFG", c = "ACDYFG")
remove_ambiguous_residues(seqs)
# Returns c(a = "ACFG", b = "ACFG", c = "ACFG")

}
