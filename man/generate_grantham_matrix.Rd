\title{Generate Grantham Distance Matrix}
\usage{
generate_grantham_matrix()
}
\value{
A 20x20 numeric matrix with row and column names corresponding to the
  one-letter codes for amino acids (lowercase), where each cell contains the
  Grantham distance between the corresponding pair of amino acids.
}
\description{
Computes a 20x20 symmetric matrix of pairwise Grantham distances between
amino acids.
}
\details{
The matrix uses the amino acid order from the Grantham distance table on
Wikipedia, based on Grantham (1984) [DOI:10.1126/science.185.4154.862]. These
distances reflect differences in composition, polarity, and molecular volume
between amino acid side chains.


This function is optimized for speed and runs quickly enough that
regenerating the matrix on each call is faster than saving/loading from disk.
