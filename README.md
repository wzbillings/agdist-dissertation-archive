**This package is still under active development. If you see this
message, assume that several parts of the package donâ€™t quite work
yet.**

## Description

**agdist** allows easy computation of antigenic distances.

## Quick example

These few lines of code produce a list of antigenic distances.

``` r
# install if needed - package is not yet on CRAN
# remotes::install_github('ahgroup/agdist')
library(agdist)
# load (and check) data
sequencedata <- read.csv("sequence-file.csv")
# compute distances
agdistances <- compute_distances(
  sequencedata$aligned_sequences,
  method = "p-epitope"
)
# look at results
agdistances
```
